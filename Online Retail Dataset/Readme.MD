# Clustering to Classification

The aim or task of this coding challenge is to create a pipeline from clusterring to classification. We use unlabeled dataset and utilise unsupervised clustering algorithm to label the data and then apply supervised classification models on the dateset

Data Set : Online Rental Dataset
For this task I am using Online Rental Data set from UCI machine learning algorithm

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail

The Dataset consists of the purchasing transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. The aim here would be to first segment customers in groups using clustering to obtain labels and then apply classification algorithm.

This dataset is interesting because it gives me some scope of applying many pre processing steps such as handing missing values, outlier detection, balancing unbalanced data etc. It also gives me a scope to apply some creative feature engineering for the customer segmentation.
